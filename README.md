# OP25_RadioReference_Import
Use your premium radio reference account to import talkgroup data and generate your trunk.tsv for OP25

Just run the script and provide the system ID (found in the url bar of radio reference on your p25 system page) and the site ID (same place, but the site page). Then just wait while it generates.
